# Introduction
This <b>smart contract</b> was written with ```solidity```, ```hardhat```, ```Pinata``` and on  ```Polygon```. It's has features such as:
- Creating of Health Center profile.
- Enabling Ratings and Review
- Ability for users to know Hospital near them with coordinates


# Technologies Used

### Polygon
We made use of pinata IPFS API using file storage to save profile images and return a cid key in other to store on the blockchain so I can retrieve the image at anytime for the account profile.
### Pinata
Chainlink automation is used to call the end meeting function which is to be called every 24hours I made use of the Time based trigger cron jobs on the chainlink automation interface
Here is link to the chainlink automation: https://automation.chain.link/mumbai/15126042871348539617950456361182166757342351262351933592710991110229343694907



# Documentation
Multiple methods and ways to interact with the ```BRISKMED``` Project. Those are listed below in detail.
### Creating Hospital Profile

### Searching Hospital Availability

### Hospitals Review & Rating


## Issues and What I Learnt
> I ran into some issues some issues like. 
- Returning a mapping in solidity, which I finally resolved to return a struct,
- Verifying my smart contract where I could not paste a code if I import a library as a single file.
- Ethers as when I reload a page I get "INVALID address ENS name error" which was fixed by properly using the useeffect.â€‹

> Some of what we learnt.
- Proper use of for loop in solidity.
- Usage of `EthersJS to interact with smart contract which include reading and writing, items like signers and providers.

### They were there to guide me through it and the bootcamp was of great Value.
